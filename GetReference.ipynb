The accuracy of Adam's anatomical structure was not surpassed in any sculpture of the fifteenth century. Rizzo's extraordinary advance in understanding of the organic\\xa0structure of the human body, I believe, was due to the influence of Antonio Pollaiuolo, from\\xa0whom Rizzo learned to imbue every part of the body with tension by the flexion of the\\xa0muscles. Flexed muscles are more prominent and more precisely defined than muscles in a\\xa0state of relaxation. Thus they produce a more richly articulated surface and more highly\\xa0inflected contours. To the same end, Adam's pose is open and joints are accentuated by being\\xa0made to protrude more sharply than they normally would do. That God is present to Adam\\xa0 is made clear by the inclination of the figure's head and the expression of his face, indeed,\\xa0the urgency of Adam's communication has given life to every portion of the figure's body.

Flexed muscles are more prominent and more precisely defined than muscles in a\\xa0state of relaxation. Thus they produce a more richly articulated surface and more highly\\xa0inflected contours. To the same end, Adam's pose is open and joints are accentuated by being\\xa0made to protrude more sharply than they normally would do. That God is present to Adam\\xa0 is made clear by the inclination of the figure's head and the expression of his face, indeed,\\xa0the urgency of Adam's communication has given life to every portion of the figure's body.

Here, in contrast to Tullio's relief, figures express feelings with far less\\xa0vehemence but a great deal more conviction by a slight turn of the torso, the inclination\\xa0of the head, or the focus of a glance. Recession into depth is gradual, abetted by the changing\\xa0views and overlapping of figures composing the semicircle around the infant, but also by\\xa0the gradual descent in the level of heads, which mitigates the isocephaly that Tullio so\\xa0carefully maintained. Although the depth of the relief is no greater than that in Tullio's\\xa0panel, forms seem a great deal more plastic because they are much more rounded,· the full\\xa0range of mezzo rilievo, keyed to location within the three-dimensional space, which Tullio\\xa0abjured, is widely utilized\", \"As in antique statuary, drapery responds to the physical\\xa0properties of its fabric, the mechanics of its draping, and the presence of underlying garments,\\xa0as well as to the figure's anatomy and pose.

Thi s cannot have been Rizzo's shop, which evidently was sold before his flight from Venice .13\\xa0 At the end of his life, Lorenzo is known to have kept a shop at Venice in the parish of S.\\xa0Severo ,·14 presumably earlier references to S. Severo in connection with Giambattista also\\xa0allude to the brothers' shop .15 At Lorenzo's death his shop contained marble blocks and live\\xa0stone, as well as implements,· the outstanding salaries of an unspecified number of garzoni\\xa0 and lavoranti eventually were paid from his estate .16 Unfortunately, the statutes of the Venetian\\xa0stonemasons' guild devote far less space to the organization of the workshop than they do\\xa0to matriculation and the payment of dues, the election of the gastaldo, and the attendance\\xa0of members at funerals and masses ,17 and therefore shed little light on the daily exercise of\\xa0the sculptor's profession in Renaissance Venice. The guild's Mariecjola tells us that it was\\xa0prohibited to continue work begun by a fellow mason who had not been paid, to work at\\xa0night without a special license or on feast days, to mix different kinds of stone in a single\\xa0work, and to keep more than three apprentices in addition to relatives 18 - but little else to\\xa0our purpose Moreover, the highly articulated system of penalties, in which the delinquent\\xa0supervisor as well as the transgressor often shared, implies that regulations represented an\\xa0ideal - not a reality. Throughout their documented careers Giambattista and Lorenzo dwelt in the parish in which their uncle had lived 19 — S. Giovanni Nuovo 20 — bordering that of S. Severo. Despite\\xa0extensive activity at Treviso, particularly in the first decade of the sixteenth century, Giambattista and Lorenzo do not seem to have set up shop there In this respect their practice\\xa0did not differ from that of Pietro or Tullio Lombardo, who also executed in Venice works\\xa0delivered to several cities in northern Italy. Indeed, since unworked Carrara marble and\\xa0Istrian limestone were regularly transshipped to the cities of the terrajerma via Venice ,21 there\\xa0would have been little advantage to such a move.

Thi s cannot have been Rizzo's shop, which evidently was sold before his flight from Venice .13\\xa0 At the end of his life, Lorenzo is known to have kept a shop at Venice in the parish of S.\\xa0Severo ,·14 presumably earlier references to S. Severo in connection with Giambattista also\\xa0allude to the brothers' shop .15 At Lorenzo's death his shop contained marble blocks and live\\xa0stone, as well as implements,· the outstanding salaries of an unspecified number of garzoni\\xa0 and lavoranti eventually were paid from his estate .16 Unfortunately, the statutes of the Venetian\\xa0stonemasons' guild devote far less space to the organization of the workshop than they do\\xa0to matriculation and the payment of dues, the election of the gastaldo, and the attendance\\xa0of members at funerals and masses ,17 and therefore shed little light on the daily exercise of\\xa0the sculptor's profession in Renaissance Venice. The guild's Mariecjola tells us that it was\\xa0prohibited to continue work begun by a fellow mason who had not been paid, to work at\\xa0night without a special license or on feast days, to mix different kinds of stone in a single\\xa0work, and to keep more than three apprentices in addition to relatives 18 - but little else to\\xa0our purpose Moreover, the highly articulated system of penalties, in which the delinquent\\xa0supervisor as well as the transgressor often shared, implies that regulations represented an\\xa0ideal - not a reality. Throughout their documented careers Giambattista and Lorenzo dwelt in the parish in which their uncle had lived 19 — S. Giovanni Nuovo 20 — bordering that of S. Severo. Despite\\xa0extensive activity at Treviso, particularly in the first decade of the sixteenth century, Giambattista and Lorenzo do not seem to have set up shop there In this respect their practice\\xa0did not differ from that of Pietro or Tullio Lombardo, who also executed in Venice works\\xa0delivered to several cities in northern Italy. Indeed, since unworked Carrara marble and\\xa0Istrian limestone were regularly transshipped to the cities of the terrajerma via Venice ,21 there\\xa0would have been little advantage to such a move.

Maria dei Servi. But the designer of the Pesaro Tomb was more faithful to\\xa0his antique prototype, as a comparison with an arch that did not commemorate a triumph\\xa0but nevertheless employed the triumphal format - the Arco dei Cavi at Verona 22 - shows.\\xa0Thus plinths, columns, and entablature at the edges of the tomb now are broken forward,\\xa0while the entire span of the entablature between the central columns also projects. In this\\xa0respect, the Pesaro Tomb participates in the general course of architectural development\\xa0around the turn of the century, not only at Venice but throughout Italy, characterized by\\xa0an increasingly accurate imitation of classical architectural vocabulary and syntax. From the\\xa0Vendramin Tomb come the roundels at the top of the lateral bays, the winged disc beneath\\xa0Pesaro's tomb chest, and the freestanding statues, as large as the life-size effigy and located\\xa0beyond the tomb's lateral boundaries. The center of the upper story, by contrast, derives in\\xa0large part from the Tomb of Giovanni Emo (d. 1483), formerly in S. Maria dei Servi, whose\\xa0design I have attributed to Tullio Lombardo. (The architectural framework of the Emo Tomb\\xa0no longer exists, but its appearance is preserved in a faithful eighteenth-century drawing by\\xa0Johannes Grevembroch.23) In the upper part of the Pesaro Tomb, as in the Emo Tomb, a\\xa0pedestrian effigy stands on a sarcophagus against a plain background and within an aedicule\\xa0framed by fluted columns of the composite order resting on tall, carved drums. The composition\\xa0of the Madonna and Child in the tympanum recalls Pyrgoteles's Madonna and Child in the\\xa0tympanum of the portal of S. Maria dei Miracoli. Despite the fact that most features of the Pesaro Tomb can be traced in earlier Venetian works, its design is unique: not even the tomb of Benedetto's son Girolamo, built at the\\xa0opposite end of the transept, imitated it .24 The unusual design of the Pesaro Tomb is due, I believe, to its dual role as the sacristy's facade and monumental entrance and as tomb. This duality is reflected in the disjunction between upper and lower stories. In the upper story are\\xa0found those elements proper to a tomb: Madonna and Child, tomb chest and effigy, freestanding\\xa0statuary and reliefs alluding to Pesaro's conquests in the Turkish War.

Probably it is one of two not yet ready for casting in October 1507,\\xa0but fully modeled when Giambattista received the final payment for his sarcophagus statuettes\\xa0in March 1508 and cast by September 1510. In its contrapposto pose and the elevation of one\\xa0arm above its head — a concession, no doubt, to the figure's intended but unrealized function\\xa0as a caryatid — Lorenzo's bronze matches its companions. The figure's torsion and coiffure\\xa0reflect Giambattista's model. But the figure's semi-nudity, better suited to a statuette of Venus\\xa0 than a personification, is unique. If Lorenzo's, this would constitute his second work, executed between the Shrine of the Three Martyrs and St. Paul Indeed, flaws in the depiction of anatomy — the inorganic juncture\\xa0of frontal abdomen and twisted rib cage or the incongruous breasts — testify to the sculptor's\\xa0immaturity. The heavy proportions of the figure are consistent with every one of Lorenzo's\\xa0figures. An identical morphology of legs and feet, with prominent shins and tumid ankles,\\xa0depressed arches and exceptionally long toes, is found later in the documented St. Christopher\\xa0 from the Altar of St. Leonard in Cesena. The draping of the figure's mantle, including the\\xa0slightly ruffled, oblique hem and the regularly curving swathe at the hip, recurs in Sf. Eustace\\xa0 from Cesena. The rigidity of long, straight folds recalls the Sacrament Chapel Paul. But it\\xa0is the figure's face, comparable in all respects to St. Tabrata and the Angels of the Sacrament\\xa0Chapel Altar, that establishes Lorenzo's authorship beyond a doubt. Nothing is known of the provenance of the statuette of St. John the Evangelist in East Berlin. Date and authorship, by contrast, can be inferred from the sculptures style. The wiglike\\xa0head of matted hair, undercut at its border with the face and falling to the shoulders in\\xa0corkscrew locks, is unmistakable. Facial features closely resemble those of Lorenzo's St. Mark¡\\xa0 the beard of the statuette is virtually identical to St. Paul's. The folds of the wide sleeves are\\xa0thickly massed at the wrists and the mantle's hem is turned up between the feet, as in the\\xa0statue of St. Paul. The composition of the figure, however, depends from prototypes by\\xa0Giambattista. From Joseph in the Visitation come the Evangelist's relatively slender proportions,\\xa0as well as the gesture of his right hand and the diagonal swathe of drapery that rises to his\\xa0shoulder.

In its contrapposto pose and the elevation of one\\xa0arm above its head — a concession, no doubt, to the figure's intended but unrealized function\\xa0as a caryatid — Lorenzo's bronze matches its companions. The figure's torsion and coiffure\\xa0reflect Giambattista's model. But the figure's semi-nudity, better suited to a statuette of Venus\\xa0 than a personification, is unique. If Lorenzo's, this would constitute his second work, executed between the Shrine of the Three Martyrs and St. Paul Indeed, flaws in the depiction of anatomy — the inorganic juncture\\xa0of frontal abdomen and twisted rib cage or the incongruous breasts — testify to the sculptor's\\xa0immaturity. The heavy proportions of the figure are consistent with every one of Lorenzo's\\xa0figures. An identical morphology of legs and feet, with prominent shins and tumid ankles,\\xa0depressed arches and exceptionally long toes, is found later in the documented St. Christopher\\xa0 from the Altar of St. Leonard in Cesena. The draping of the figure's mantle, including the\\xa0slightly ruffled, oblique hem and the regularly curving swathe at the hip, recurs in Sf. Eustace\\xa0 from Cesena. The rigidity of long, straight folds recalls the Sacrament Chapel Paul. But it\\xa0is the figure's face, comparable in all respects to St. Tabrata and the Angels of the Sacrament\\xa0Chapel Altar, that establishes Lorenzo's authorship beyond a doubt. Nothing is known of the provenance of the statuette of St. John the Evangelist in East Berlin. Date and authorship, by contrast, can be inferred from the sculptures style. The wiglike\\xa0head of matted hair, undercut at its border with the face and falling to the shoulders in\\xa0corkscrew locks, is unmistakable. Facial features closely resemble those of Lorenzo's St. Mark¡\\xa0 the beard of the statuette is virtually identical to St. Paul's. The folds of the wide sleeves are\\xa0thickly massed at the wrists and the mantle's hem is turned up between the feet, as in the\\xa0statue of St. Paul. The composition of the figure, however, depends from prototypes by\\xa0Giambattista. From Joseph in the Visitation come the Evangelist's relatively slender proportions,\\xa0as well as the gesture of his right hand and the diagonal swathe of drapery that rises to his\\xa0shoulder. So similar to Giambattista's St. Peter is St. John's pose and the configuration of folds\\xa0where the mantle is wrapped around the legs and the tunic adheres to the chest, that we\\xa0may posit for the Evangelist a terminus post cfuem of late 1509.\"]}\n",

The contraction of the abdominal muscles as an involuntary and spasmodic response to pain, in\\xa0Bartolomeo's St. Sebastian and Michelangelo's Slave, contrast with the voluptuous relaxation\\xa0of the muscles of Lorenzo's St. Sebastian. To the Saint's composure, the undisturbed configuration of the intricately twisted swathes of drapery bear final witness.

St. Paul is typical of a debutant in its presumptuous claims of virtuosity at the expense of composition. But pressed by several exacting\\xa0commissions, Lorenzo rapidly matured. In part, the consistency of the formed artist is\\xa0explained by the brevity of Bregno's career, which did not exceed nineteen years, and by\\xa0the overlapping of many of his works. More important still was the absence of any stimulus\\xa0to change.

Lorenzo no longer\\xa0sought to copy nature. Rather, his goal was the creation of works of art that could be judged\\xa0by the standard of ancient Roman sculpture. Roman sculpture taught Lorenzo the virtues of\\xa0monumentality and generalization, of maintaining a certain distance from reality by the\\xa0depiction of a uniformly heroic figure type. His conscious imitation of antique dress and\\xa0hair, facial types, masculine anatomy, and contrapposto produced works that emulated the best\\xa0examples of Roman statuary. His relief with its fully rounded forms that recede gradually\\xa0until intersected by the background, mirrors classical relief. In his disdain for linear and\\xa0plastic definition, for virtuoso carving of details, or prodigious feats of undercutting, Lorenzo\\xa0adapted his own technique to the limitations of ancient sculptors.

By contrast, the enthusiasm for classical sculpture that conditioned Lorenzo's later\\xa0work so fundamentally, affected his early work as well. Therefore, the differences between\\xa0earlier and later works are determined chiefly by errors in the depiction of anatomy and the\\xa0pondération of figures that were later rectified. St. Paul is typical of a debutant in its presumptuous claims of virtuosity at the expense of composition. But pressed by several exacting\\xa0commissions, Lorenzo rapidly matured. In part, the consistency of the formed artist is\\xa0explained by the brevity of Bregno's career, which did not exceed nineteen years, and by\\xa0the overlapping of many of his works. More important still was the absence of any stimulus\\xa0to change. During the period of Lorenzo's activity, most major works of Venetian sculpture\\xa0not made by either Bregno were realized by sculptors older by at least a generation and still\\xa0working in a Quattrocento idiom, unquestionably, Lorenzo's work represents the most advanced and progressive Venetian sculpture of his time. Not until shortly before Lorenzo's\\xa0death did Mosca's statues for the High Altar of S. Rocco challenge the modernity of Bregno's art. Four years after Giambattista, Lorenzo made his first appearance in the documents,· for the next several years, he seems to have held a subordinate position in his brother's shop.\\xa0What the archival data suggest - that Lorenzo was Giambattista's junior - the stylistic data\\xa0abundantly confirm: where Giambattista's sculpture belongs to the art of the late Quattrocento, the proper context for Lorenzo's art is the High Renaissance. Lorenzo no longer\\xa0sought to copy nature. Rather, his goal was the creation of works of art that could be judged\\xa0by the standard of ancient Roman sculpture. Roman sculpture taught Lorenzo the virtues of\\xa0monumentality and generalization, of maintaining a certain distance from reality by the\\xa0depiction of a uniformly heroic figure type. His conscious imitation of antique dress and\\xa0hair, facial types, masculine anatomy, and contrapposto produced works that emulated the best\\xa0examples of Roman statuary. His relief with its fully rounded forms that recede gradually\\xa0until intersected by the background, mirrors classical relief. In his disdain for linear and\\xa0plastic definition, for virtuoso carving of details, or prodigious feats of undercutting, Lorenzo\\xa0adapted his own technique to the limitations of ancient sculptors. His repetition of a limited\\xa0repertory of types and compositions, which robbed the smallest elements, as well as larger\\xa0forms, of their identity and singularity, corresponds to the restricted canon of subjects and 29 For the attribution of the Orsini\"]}\n",

Lorenzo was employed by the Bragadin family at S. Marina,\\xa0by Lodovico Basadonna, Podestà at Montagnana.39 Though a religious, Giambattista's patron\\xa0at S.

In the\\xa0second contract of May 23, 1505, in which Leopardi\\xa0was replaced by Zanin Alberghetto and Pietro dalle\\xa0Campane, mention again was made of the six figures,\\xa0which were to surround the Zen sarcophagus like\\xa0those in the Giustiniani Tomb.

Apparently this figure\\xa0was not finished - indeed, by June Antonio was\\xa0settled in Ferrara15 - for on July 31,1506, the procurators made another contract for all six figures with\\xa0the woodcarver Paolo Savin and Giambattista Bre-gno, called \"Joannes Baptista, lapicida in Sancto Joanne Novo.\" The two men were to be held jointly\\xa0responsible for the six figures,· clay and wax were\\xa0to be supplied at their own expense.

On March 28, 1508, when Pietro was paid for the\\xa0casting of the four figures, however, work was still\\xa0in progress. Casting apparently was finished by May\\xa026, 1508. The two figures missing in October 1507,\\xa0when the contract for casting had been made, evidently were complete by March 28, 1508, when\\xa0Giambattista received his final payment of 10 ducats,\\xa0for a total equivalent to Savin\\'s of 40 ducats. Giambattista\\'s payment, however, was made explicitly, not\\xa0for three figures, but for four. The last two figures of\\xa0the tomb were cast between May 26, 1508 and September 24, 1510.17 While the documents shed light on the figures of the tomb by demonstrating the equal responsibility\\xa0of Paolo Savin and Giambattista Bregno and by fixing\\xa0termini for the modeling of the figures between July\\xa031, 1506, and March 28, 1508, the figures, in turn,\\xa0shed light on the documents. It has long been recognized that the three figures on the east face of\\xa0the Zen sarcophagus are uniform in style and motif,·\\xa0stylistically related to the Ejfitjy oj Cardinal Zen, St.\\xa0Peter, and the altar\\'s antependium — works documented as Savin\\'s — they can be indentified with that\\xa0half of the group of six, for which Savin was paid.\\xa0By contrast, the three figures on the opposite face\\xa0are different in style, not only from Savin\\'s figures,\\xa0but from each other. The central figure alone bears\\xa0features attributable to Giambattista Bregno. The figure at the right-hand comer of the sarcophagus evidently was modeled by Lorenzo, while the figure at\\xa0the left-hand corner seems to belong to an anonymous member of Giambattista\\'s shop. Which of the six figures are the four that were waiting to be cast before the contract with Pietro\\xa0dalle Campane was signed on October 14, 1507?\\xa0There are four — namely, Savin\\'s three and the one\\xa0by Giambattista Bregno — which form a set because\\xa0they, unlike the other two, are dressed identically in\\xa0chitons and himations, we may assume hypothetically that these four, therefore, are the ones that were\\xa0cast first. Giambattista\\'s final payment, in which a fee\\xa0initially stipulated for three figures, was made to cover\\xa0four, poses another problem. I suspect that the extra\\xa0figure was Antonio Lombardo\\'s Temperance, which apparently Giambattista finished and set in the center\\xa0of the sarcophagus. If so, one of the figures modeled\\xa0ex novo in Bregno\\'s shop eventually was discarded. The document of January 19, 1504, which fixed the form and dimensions of the cardinal’s sepulchre,\\xa0prescribed that the six figures resemble those of the Tomb of Orsato Giustiniani (d. 1464). The Giustiniani Tomb attributed to Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino was erected between ca. 1462 and ca. 1466 in the Church of SS. Eufemia, Dorothy, Tecla, and\\xa0Erasma in the minor cloister of the Venetian Church\\xa0of S. Andrea della Certosa. The tomb was apparently\\xa0destroyed at the beginning of the 19th century: only\\xa0five of its six statuettes survive.18 Fortunately, the\\xa0tomb\\'s appearance is preserved in a drawing by Johannes Grevembroch.19 It proves the Giustiniani\\xa0Tomb to have influenced the Tomb of Cardinal Zen\\xa0in more than just the employment of female figures:\\xa0in fact, the Zen and Giustiniani Tombs are unique\\xa0in Venetian funerary sculpture in consisting of freestanding sarcophagi set on the ground, in the manner\\xa0of northern European tombs. Both stood at the center\\xa0of a richly ornamented funerary chapel. In both, on\\xa0either side of the parallelipiped sarcophagus, three\\xa0freestanding female figures on circular bases framed\\xa0two rectangular decorative panels in relief.20 Above\\xa0the sarcophagus, the three-dimensional effigy rested\\xa0on a low bier with two cushions at the head, one at\\xa0the feet. However, in contrast to the Virtues of the\\xa0Giustiniani Tomb, only one of the figures of the Zen\\xa0Tomb bears an identifiable attribute — four bear none\\xa0at all - and therefore the Zen figures cannot be construed as Virtues. (The single exception is a figure\\xa0holding what appears to be a mirror — an attribute\\xa0of Prudence.21) Indeed, with the exception of Antonio\\xa0Lombardo\\'s abortive Temperance, the documents never\\xa0call the Zen statuettes anything but \"figure\" or \"figúrete.\" Nevertheless, in a quest for specificity, evidently\\xa0alien to the mentality of Venetian patrons of the\\xa0Renaissance, writers on the tomb since Stringa have\\xa0preferred to name them Faith, Hope, Charity, Prudence, Mercy, and Munificence — those virtues, it was\\xa0supposed, preeminently possessed by Cardinal Zen.22 Until 1778, when Temanza reported on the documents he had found in the archive of the Procurators of St. Mark with the names of Antonio Lombardo,\\xa0Alessandro Leopardi, Giovanni (or Zanin) Alber-ghetto and Pietro dalle Campane, no attempt was\\xa0made to attribute the sculpture of the Cappella Zen.\\xa0Temanza compounded the problems of attribution\\xa0by assigning to Pietro Lombardo a decisive role in\\xa0the design and execution of the chapel\\'s sculpture on\\xa0the basis of a document that shows Pietro acting as\\xa0Antonio\\'s procurator, after the latter\\'s departure for\\xa0Ferrara. On the other hand, Temanza introduced Paolo Savin, as responsible in some measure for the\\xa0tomb chest and its figures, to the literature.23 Te-', 'title': [\"were cast between May 26, 1508 and September 24, 1510.17 While the documents shed light on the figures of the tomb by demonstrating the equal responsibility\\xa0of Paolo Savin and Giambattista Bregno and by fixing\\xa0termini for the modeling of the figures between July\\xa031, 1506, and March 28, 1508, the figures, in turn,\\xa0shed light on the documents. It has long been recognized that the three figures on the east face of\\xa0the Zen sarcophagus are uniform in style and motif,·\\xa0stylistically related to the Ejfitjy oj Cardinal Zen, St.\\xa0Peter, and the altar's antependium — works documented as Savin's — they can be indentified with that\\xa0half of the group of six, for which Savin was paid.\\xa0By contrast, the three figures on the opposite face\\xa0are different in style, not only from Savin's figures,\\xa0but from each other. The central figure alone bears\\xa0features attributable to Giambattista Bregno. The figure at the right-hand comer of the sarcophagus evidently was modeled by Lorenzo, while the figure at\\xa0the left-hand corner seems to belong to an anonymous member of Giambattista's shop. Which of the six figures are the four that were waiting to be cast before the contract with Pietro\\xa0dalle Campane was signed on October 14, 1507?\\xa0There are four — namely, Savin's three and the one\\xa0by Giambattista Bregno — which form a set because\\xa0they, unlike the other two, are dressed identically in\\xa0chitons and himations, we may assume hypothetically that these four, therefore, are the ones that were\\xa0cast first. Giambattista's final payment, in which a fee\\xa0initially stipulated for three figures, was made to cover\\xa0four, poses another problem. I suspect that the extra\\xa0figure was Antonio Lombardo's Temperance, which apparently Giambattista finished and set in the center\\xa0of the sarcophagus.

Made of rough blocks of Istrian limestone, the\\xa0counterfeit sepulchre was hollow. Hung about the\\xa0interior were small paintings of the Passion of Christ.\\xa0It was here that the Altar of S. Martino stood. Within\\xa0the grotto, on either side, two flights of eight marble\\xa0steps led to a crypt below, where a miraculous life-size wooden image of the Dead Christ was preserved\\xa0on another altar.4 Several early sources describe the altar of the sepulchre, the earliest and most detailed occurs in Strin-ga's 1604 edition of Sansovino's guide of 1581. It reads: Qui dentro [the grotto] vi è un'altare di marmo molto ricco, e bello così per disegno, come per finezza di pietre. Egli\\xa0è da quatre Angioli scolpiti in marmo assai belli, sostenuto\\xa0in aria. Nel suo parapetto\"]}\n",

In the mid-1490s, he\\xa0served Ferdinand II of Naples against the French. In\\xa01495 he assisted Ottaviano di Carlo Manfredi, supported by the Florentines, in Ottaviano\\'s abortive\\xa0attempt to regain Faenza. In 1500 Dionigi subdued\\xa0Brisighella in the name of Duke Valentino Borgia.4\\xa0A captain of infantry, Dionigi entered Venetian employ in 1504.5 Under Bartolomeo d\\'Alviano, he and\\xa0his troops fought at Agnadello on May 14, 1509\\xa0against the army of the League of Cambrai.15 On May\\xa017, 1509, the Senate placed Naldi in charge of all\\xa0infantry.7 Naldi reconquered Castelfranco from\\xa0Spanish forces8 and, in November 1509, helped retake Vicenza.9 Garrisoned at Padua with his 800\\xa0troops, Dionigi died of a fever, brought on by exhaustion, a couple of hours after midnight on July\\xa024, 1510. News of the condottiere\\' s death reached Venice later the same day. The Collegio determined that\\xa0Naldi\\'s body be brought from Padua and placed in\\xa0a coffin in SS. Giovanni e Paolo. Ser Giorgio Emo,\\xa0who had arranged the funeral of the late Capitano\\xa0Generale, Nicolò Orsini, Count of Pitigliano (d. Jan.\\xa026, 1510 l0), was ordered to arrange similar exequies\\xa0for Naldi. Emo had Naldi\\'s coffin, draped with black\\xa0velvet, set up in SS. Giovanni e Paolo, near that of\\xa0Nicolò Orsini,· beneath Naldi\\'s coffin was an epitaph\\xa0whose text was later incoporated in his tomb. But\\xa0because of the extraordinary heat and fear of epidemic, a funeral was not held.\" The Council of Ten\\xa0granted Dionigi\\'s widow 100 ducats from income\\xa0from possessions confiscated from Paduan rebels.12 On July 31, 1512, the Council of Ten with its Giunta decided that there be erected in SS. Giovanni\\xa0e Paolo three tombs in honor of Orsini, Naldi, and\\xa0Fra Leonardo da Prato, leader of Venice\\'s light cavalry, who had died in the field toward the end of March 1511 .13 The exiguous sum of three hundred ducats was allocated to the tombs,· two of the three\\xa0heads of the Council of Ten were to attend to the\\xa0matter. In payment for the tomb sites, the council\\xa0moved that the friars of SS. Giovanni e Paolo be\\xa0given the gold and velvet cloths then covering the\\xa0caskets of Orsini and Naldi respectively, in order to\\xa0make two vestments.14 On August 19, 1512, the friars\\xa0of SS. Giovanni e Paolo granted Giorgio Emo\\'s petition to be allowed to erect three tombs in the church\\xa0in honor of Orsini, Naldi, and Fra Leonardo,· Emo\\xa0was permitted to choose the tombs\\' sites.15 Thus it\\xa0would appear that Emo had charge of the project.\\xa0From Sanuto we learn that Fra Leonardo\\'s coffin,\\xa0draped in black velvet, was set up in SS. Giovanni e\\xa0Paolo ca. September 17, 1512, on the opposite side\\xa0of the church from the coffin of Nicolò Orsini.16\\xa0Work of construction was under way on January 5,\\xa01513, when, at Emo\\'s instance, the convent ceded\\xa0four marble columns for the (unnamed) tomb then\\xa0being built.17 Describing indulgences granted SS.\\xa0Giovanni e Paolo by Pope Leo X, Sanuto reported\\xa0on December 24, 1514, that the Tombs of the Count\\xa0of Pitigliano and of Fra Leonardo da Prato had been\\xa0erected on either side of the choir, and that the Tomb\\xa0of Dionigi Naldi was being made over the door.18\\xa0Naldi\\'s tomb was still not finished on March 21, 1515,\\xa0when Sanuto included, among the works undertaken\\xa0by Giorgio Emo for the embellishment of SS. Giovanni e Paolo (whose procurator he had become at\\xa0the end of 151319), the construction of the portal in\\xa0the choir, above which Naldi\\'s tomb was to be installed. Until some of the tombs outside were removed, on which work had begun that very day, the\\xa0portal could not be breached. Nor was the great\\xa0stained-glass window behind Naldi\\'s effigy, which\\xa0Emo intended to have completed, quite finished.20\\xa0There is no reason to suppose that work on the window, portal, and tomb was greatly protracted after\\xa0this.21 The epitaphs of Naldi\\'s tomb and coffin make clear that monument and lying-in-state were accorded the\\xa0 condottiere by a grateful Senate for the loyalty and\\xa0fortitude with which he had served at Padua.22 Indeed, Naldi\\'s tomb and lying-in-state were clearly\\xa0part of a programmatic effort by the Senate and\\xa0Council of Ten to remember and honor, publicly and\\xa0permanently, those condottieri who had died in Venetian service at the siege of Padua.23 But the chief\\xa0motive of this display — one that had a greater weight\\xa0even than gratitude — was the desire of the Venetian\\xa0 Signoria to ensure the allegiance of future mercenary', 'title': ['Dionigi di Giovanni Naldi was born in 1465 in Brisighella, south of Faenza.

La scelta della località dove costruire il nuovo tempio implicava aspetti\\xa0pratici ma anche scelte politiche e\\xa0indirizzi culturali che vennero ampiamente discussi. Si esaminò, in\\xa0particolare, l’offerta gratuita di un\\xa0terreno da parte delle suore clarisse\\xa0di Santa Croce. La salvezza dalla\\xa0peste e dal peccato che ne è causa,\\xa0affermavano le monache, non poteva\\xa0venire che dalla Croce redentrice di\\xa0Cristo e quindi il luogo ideale era la\\xa0loro chiesa poiché possedeva una\\xa0preziosa reliquia. Alla fine fu scelto\\xa0come luogo l’isola della Giudecca,\\xa0dove sorgeva la chiesetta di Santa\\xa0Maria degli Angeli e un romitorio di\\xa0frati cappuccini, che accolsero con\\xa0gioia di officiare il nuovo tempio. Il tema della Croce è centro focale del messaggio francescano, configura l’immagine stessa di Francesco, e\\xa0proprio al fervore delle origini proponeva di ricondursi il movimento\\xa0riformato dei cappuccini. La prima pietra fu posta il 3 maggio 1577, «giorno dell’invenrione della Santissima Croce del Redentor nostro», portando così a completa e-spressione il tema cristologico che d’ora in poi sarà motivo programmatico. Quando le fondamenta ne rivelarono la grandiosità, i cappuccini stabilirono nuovi patti, facendo intervenire perfino il papa, per salvaguardare il loro voto di povertà: avrebbero\\xa0ceduto gratis il terreno, officiato gratuitamente nel tempio, il monastero\\xa0doveva essere di semplice struttura e\\xa0le celle dovevano essere quelle tradizionalmente piccole, nulla doveva\\xa0essere di loro proprietà.

Le due\\xa0 3 statue di San Lorenzo Giustiniani e\\xa0Sant’Antonio di Padova, non ricordate nel decreto del 1673, sembrano\\xa0essere state realizzate, sempre per\\xa0considerazioni stilistiche, verso il\\xa01700. A sinistra del portale la presenza di san Marco esprime un significato civico e allo stesso tempo religioso. Questo aspetto è completato\\xa0daH’immagine posta sul registro\\xa0superiore da questo lato della facciata: san Lorenzo Giustiniani. Egli era\\xa0stato primo patriarca di Venezia e la\\xa0sua immagine ricorda il momento\\xa0importantissimo in cui la città aveva\\xa0acquistato maggiore indipendenza e\\xa0prestigio; era anche particolarmente\\xa0invocato nelle pestilenze, nella\\xa0memoria di quanto si era prodigato\\xa0nel corso di due analoghe calamità.\\xa0Sul lato destro del portale, l’immagine di san Francesco ricorda la ragione profonda che aveva indotto alla\\xa0scelta del romitorio cappuccino; essa\\xa0era stata espressa anche nella formula della dedicazione «in onore di Cristo redentore e di san Francesco\\xa0confessore». Gli corrisponde, su\\xa0questo stesso lato, il francescano\\xa0sant’Antonio di Padova, uno dei santi più amati, invocato in ogni quotidiana necessità. Al vertice della facciata, e ancor più inserita nel signifi- 1 cato del tempio, la Fede, posta tra\\xa0due angeli, porta in mano un calice,\\xa0quasi a raccogliere il sangue redentore che, scende dalla croce tenuta nella sua sinistra. Sulla lanterna della\\xa0i cupola il Redentore con il vessillo\\xa0della resurrezione corona il tempio\\xa0fin dal giorno della sua consacrazione. All’interno, lungo la navata, profeti e sibille dovevano prefigurare lo scopo\\xa0di un cammino che avrebbe raggiunto, oltre la grande arcata terminale, i\\xa0grandi simboli della Redenzione.\\xa0Sopra il Crocifisso la cupola si sareb - 21\\xa0be rivelata progressivamente allo\\xa0sguardo con gli Apostoli nelle dodici\\xa0nicchie del tamburo, con i quattro\\xa0 Evangelisti nelle nicchie superiori\\xa0dei quattro pilastri angolari e i quattro Dottori della Chiesa in quelle\\xa0inferiori. La Rivelazione segue perciò un tragitto che dagli apostoli, agli\\xa0evangelisti, ai dottori scende, in successione coerente, dalla cupola verso\\xa0il popolo cristiano. Ma il programma\\xa0non può essere stato immaginato in\\xa0modo così incompleto, privo della\\xa0sua origine, Cristo stesso. Nelle sagome dipinte e nelle rappresentazioni\\xa0pittoriche che attraverso i secoli\\xa0immaginarono la chiesa completata,\\xa0gli apostoli nel tamburo della cupola\\xa0hanno spesso il braccio teso verso\\xa0l’alto a indicare l’immagine del\\xa0Risorto posta· sopra la lanterna. Da\\xa0quel centro la luce scende a inondare\\xa0Tinterno con lo stesso significato che\\xa0l’immagine esterna propone da lontano al tragitto processionale. Essa\\xa0assume un valore profondamente\\xa0simbolico di elevazione e di purificazione.

Sull’immagine della luce,\\xa0continuamente presente nel Prologo\\xa0 del quarto Vangelo, l’arte si era\\xa0cimentata da alcuni secoli, riuscendo\\xa0a sostituire i semplici raggi che\\xa0aureolavano il Bambino con la luce\\xa0che da lui stesso promanava: «In lui\\xa0era la vita, e la vita era la luce degli\\xa0uomini.

In perfetta adesione al testo evangelico, i cieli si aprono attorno alla presenza amorosa dello Spirito\\xa0Santo; la sua luce scende sul braccio\\xa0sollevato di Giovanni Battista e sul\\xa0corpo di Cristo. In questo momento\\xa0Gesù è rivelato come figlio amato dal\\xa0Padre e inizia la sua vita pubblica. Il\\xa0 Battesimo di Cristo è posto subito\\xa0dopo la Natività ed è immediatamente\\xa0seguito dagli episodi della Passione.\\xa0Esso, infatti, è inserito nel circuito delle cappelle del Redentore secondo la\\xa0lettura proposta dall’apostolo Paolo:\\xa0«Siamo stati sepolti con lui nella morte mediante ü battesimo, affinché\\xa0come Cristo è risuscitato dai morti,\\xa0per la gloria del Padre, così noi pure\\xa0dobbiamo camminare in una vita nuova» (Romani 6, 4 ). Il tragitto procede con estrema coerenza interna, privilegiando i temi della Passione. La Flagellazione di\\xa0Cristo (Domenico tintoretto), nella\\xa0terza cappella, allude anche ad altre\\xa0forme di offesa con il drappo rosso, la\\xa0canna e la corona di spine sul pavimento. Con questi riferimenti alle\\xa0colpe umane, l’opera si carica di un\\xa0messaggio diretto che giustifica il patetismo della figura centrale. Certamente lontano dalla nostra sensibilità\\xa0è quel riconoscere la cospirazione e il\\xa0tradimento nell’immagine di un e-breo. Il riferimento principale va però\\xa0all’ipocrisia di chi vuole rispettare\\xa0solo formalmente la legge, rappresentata dai filatteri che pendono ai lati\\xa0della fronte. Ad altre colpe che «flagellano» Cristo, alludono gli adunchi\\xa0profili dei tre personaggi sullo sfondo\\xa0a sinistra. In tutte le pale del Redentore, anche in quelle in cui il tema non\\xa0lo prevede espressamente, i cieli sono\\xa0aperti verso l’alto, alludendo al messaggio fondamentale di tutta la\\xa0costruzione: «Per crucem ad lucem».\\xa0Come in altri cicli veneziani, nella\\xa0chiesa del Redentore manca la raffigurazione dell’Ultima Cena, sostituita\\xa0dall’altare su cui l’Eucarestia si rinnova ogni giorno. Anche la Crocifissione non è rappresentata con una pala,\\xa0ma è presente sopra l’altare con il\\xa0grande Crocifisso. A questa raffigurazione del sacrificio di Cristo si dette\\xa0sviluppo narrativo inserendo due bassorilievi con la Salita al Calvario e la 22\\xa0 Deposizione dalla Croce sulla fronte e\\xa0sul retro dell’altare. Il percorso continua con il Trasporto 12 del Cristo al sepolcro (palma il giovane). Gli episodi scorrono continui,\\xa0disposti attorno al sepolcro. L’occhio\\xa0discende sul vestito rosso di Niccode-mo, scorre lungo l’ampio gesto di\\xa0Maria Maddalena e il corpo abbandonato di Cristo, sostenuto da Giuseppe d’Arimatea, raggiunge il silenzioso dolore delle pie donne, lo svenimento di Maria. La madre ha ormai\\xa0sentito la spada che, secondo la profezia, doveva trapassarle il cuore; sul\\xa0suo petto si appoggia la mano consapevole di una pia donna. Giovanni,\\xa0l’apostolo prediletto, appare di lato,\\xa0incuriosito e stupito, con lo sguardo\\xa0fisso sul sepolcro vuoto. La sua fede,\\xa0che lo farà giungere per primo al\\xa0sepolcro vuoto nel mattino di Pasqua,\\xa0gli ricorda le parole del Maestro e la\\xa0sua destra protende già in primo piano il segno della profezia: «Al terzo\\xa0giorno risorgerò». Questo presentimento di resurrezione nel momento\\xa0della deposizione è iconograficamente abbastanza testimoniato ma in questa chiesa assume un significato pregnante. Nella Resurrezione di Cristo della ij cappella successiva, Francesco bas-sano ripropone la contrapposizione\\xa0fra luce e tenebre. La splendente immagine di Cristo è unica fonte luminosa contro il lontano bagliore di un\\xa0nuovo giorno. In posizione privilegiata, tradotta nelle cordiali forme\\xa0narrative di questo pittore, possiamo\\xa0tuttavia riconoscere di nuovo il permanere dei simboli eucaristici.\\xa0Nell’ultima cappella, la tela dell’A- 14\\xa0 scensione di Cristo conclude il ciclo\\xa0(Domenico tintoretto).

Il paliotto è realizzato secondo il metodo della «lacca povera». La tecnica è originale invenzione dei «de-pentori» veneziani per realizzare decorazioni complesse e di grande effetto con una spesa contenuta. L’artigiano utilizzava stampine, per lo più\\xa0ricavate da matrici in legno che\\xa0applicava sul fondo preparato a gesso\\xa0e colla, colorandole se era il caso e\\xa0incorniciandole con ornati tracciati a\\xa0mano o ricavati da altre stampe.
